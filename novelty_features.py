# =============================================================================
# INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS
# =============================================================================

INTEGRATION_GUIDE = """
=============================================================================
HOW TO INTEGRATE NOVELTY FEATURES INTO inference_api.py
=============================================================================

STEP 1 — Import this module at the top of inference_api.py:
    from novelty_features import register_novelty_endpoints, add_novelty_gradio_tabs

STEP 2 — Initialize engines on the chatbot (in __init__ or setup):
    # After chatbot is created:
    from novelty_features import (EmotionalStateEngine, CounterfactualHistoryEngine,
        NarrativeBranchingEngine, SocraticDebateEngine, EvidenceWeightSystem,
        CrossEraConversationEngine, HistoricalPuzzleGenerator, ArtifactAuthenticator)
    chatbot.emotional_engine   = EmotionalStateEngine()
    chatbot.counterfactual_eng = CounterfactualHistoryEngine()
    chatbot.narrative_engine   = NarrativeBranchingEngine()
    chatbot.debate_engine      = SocraticDebateEngine()
    chatbot.evidence_system    = EvidenceWeightSystem()
    chatbot.cross_era_engine   = CrossEraConversationEngine()
    chatbot.puzzle_generator   = HistoricalPuzzleGenerator()
    chatbot.artifact_auth      = ArtifactAuthenticator()

STEP 3 — Register Flask endpoints (at the END of create_flask_api()):
    register_novelty_endpoints(app, chatbot)
    return app

STEP 4 — Add Gradio tabs (inside create_gradio_ui(), at the end of the Blocks context):
    add_novelty_gradio_tabs(chatbot)

STEP 5 — Enrich generate_answer() to use emotional state + cross-era:
    # In generate_answer(), after getting char/session:
    if hasattr(self, 'emotional_engine'):
        emotion = self.emotional_engine.update_emotion(session_id, char_id, query)
        # Add emotion modifier to prompt
    if hasattr(self, 'cross_era_engine'):
        cross_era = self.cross_era_engine.generate_cross_era_response(char_id, query)
        if cross_era:
            result['cross_era_reaction'] = cross_era

=============================================================================
NEW API ENDPOINTS ADDED
=============================================================================

POST /emotion/state          — Update & query character emotional state
POST /counterfactual         — Generate What-If alternative timelines
POST /narrative/start        — Start interactive historical RPG scenario
POST /narrative/choose       — Make a choice in the narrative
POST /debate/start           — Start Socratic debate between characters
POST /debate/next            — Advance to next debate round
POST /debate/vote            — Vote on debate winner
GET  /debate/topics          — List available debate topics
GET  /evidence/check         — Get evidence weight ratings for claims
POST /crossera/react         — Historical character reacts to modern concept
POST /puzzle/generate        — Generate cause→effect gap puzzle
POST /puzzle/check           — Check user's puzzle answer
POST /artifact/authenticate  — Authenticate an artifact description

=============================================================================
WHY THESE FEATURES ARE BETTER THAN CHATGPT
=============================================================================

1. EMOTIONAL STATE ENGINE
   ChatGPT: Characters always respond in the same flat tone regardless of topic
   This system: Characters develop trust, defensiveness, joy based on conversation history
   — The King BECOMES defensive when you mention Portuguese conquest

2. COUNTERFACTUAL ENGINE
   ChatGPT: Generic "that's an interesting question" + vague speculation
   This system: Structured cascading timelines with probability ratings and character reactions

3. NARRATIVE BRANCHING
   ChatGPT: Forgets game state immediately; cannot maintain consistent branching story
   This system: Full session-persistent RPG with XP, consequences, and multiple scenarios

4. SOCRATIC DEBATE
   ChatGPT: Presents "both sides" blandly from its own perspective
   This system: Two historical characters argue IN THEIR OWN VOICES with round structure + live voting

5. EVIDENCE WEIGHT SYSTEM
   ChatGPT: Presents all claims with equal confidence ("The Relic arrived in the 4th century CE")
   This system: "Primary document 95% weight + oral tradition 50% = 73% overall confidence"

6. CROSS-ERA CONVERSATION
   ChatGPT: Will try to "imagine" this but has no character-consistent framework
   This system: Character values + historical knowledge used to generate era-consistent reactions

7. HISTORICAL PUZZLES
   ChatGPT: Can generate quiz questions but not cause→effect gap puzzles with answer checking
   This system: Structured puzzles with semantic similarity answer scoring

8. ARTIFACT AUTHENTICATOR
   ChatGPT: Has no artifact profile database and cannot return structured authentication
   This system: Cross-references known Sri Lankan artifact profiles with red-flag detection
