causal_knowledge_graph.py
=========================
Full Causal Knowledge Graph + Contradiction Engine for Sri Lanka Historical Chatbot.

Replaces the basic CausalChainEngine with:
  - NetworkX directed acyclic graph of historical facts/events
  - Temporal constraint solver (year-tagged nodes)
  - Anachronism detection (character knowledge window enforcement)
  - Causal path inference (multi-hop reasoning)
  - Contradiction detection (false premises, wrong causality)
  - Live claim validation against the graph
  - Flask endpoint integration  (/causal/*)
  - Flutter-ready JSON API

Usage:
    from causal_knowledge_graph import CausalKnowledgeGraph, ContradictionEngine

    graph  = CausalKnowledgeGraph()
    engine = ContradictionEngine(graph)

    # In your generate_answer pipeline:
    validation = engine.validate_claim(query, character_id)
    chain      = graph.get_causal_path("dutch_arrival", "british_takeover")
